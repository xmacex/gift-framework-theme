          Blend the physical and the digital with beautiful, machine readable markers.
        </h1>
        <p>
          Augmented reality has proved to be a popular type of technology for supporting interactive museum experiences due to its potential to directly connect objects, labels, posters and a range of materials that would be found around the museum to digital content. One particular form – QR codes – are an established interactive visual marker technology within museum settings: a QR code is added to a physical object, allowing visitors to use their mobile to “scan” the object and access associated digital content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the GIFT Project, we have begun to consider how interactive visual markers can be used to allow visitors to create and send hybrid gifts. To break away from the aesthetic limitations of QR codes we are using the Artcodes platform. Artcodes markers are pre-designed rather than automatically generated, based on some simple topological rules. However, as a result, they can be playfully disguised by an artist within wider images, quite different looking images can map to common digital content, and there is the potential to systematically generate large numbers of variations that, while looking similar to humans, are individually identifiable.

        <p>
          Artcodes provides an app that enables users to directly map visual markers to their own digital content to create experiences and then share (or ‘gift’) these with others. This has previously been used to turn a wide variety of objects – from gift cards to ceramic plates, to an acoustic guitar – into hybrid gifts. Going forward, the GIFT Project is producing an augmented reality app based on Artcodes that will allow museum visitors to annotate exhibits with their personal visual marker, and use this to share personalised content with other visitors. The GIFT AR Sharing app is currently under development. Please check back throughout 2018 for details on downloading the app from Apple and Google app stores.
